## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Materialize
- AJAX
- Teleport API
- Open Weather API
- jQuery
- JavaScript

## Difficulties:
One main difficulty was returning the embedded information in Teleport's API. When the user entered the city, Teleport returned all of the city's, countries, states, etc. matching the input. I had to create all of those cities as links, and then once the user clicked on a link, return the information about that specific city.
